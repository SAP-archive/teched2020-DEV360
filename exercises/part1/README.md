# PART 1: SETTING UP YOUR TRIAL ACCOUNT

In this section, you will set up your subaccount in the SAP Cloud Platform Trial using the new CLI.
You will perform the following steps:
1.	View information for your global account.
2.	Create a subaccount.
3.	Assign entitlements to the subaccount you created.

So that an application can consume services, you should first make sure the relevant entitlements for these services are assigned to the subaccount. Assigning entitlements to subaccounts allows you to distribute and limit the required quota from the global account to subaccounts.

In this section, you will work with the CLI for SAP Cloud Platform to get the information about your global account.

1. Open the [SAP Cloud Platform Trial landing page](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit#/home/trial).
